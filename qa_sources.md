# How to get your RAG application to return sources

Often in Q&A applications it's important to show users the sources that were used to generate the answer. The simplest way to do this is for the chain to return the Documents that were retrieved in each generation.

We'll work off of the Q&A app we built over the [LLM Powered Autonomous Agents](https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-06-23-agent/) blog post by Lilian Weng in the [RAG tutorial](/docs/tutorials/rag).

We will cover two approaches:

1. Using the built-in [create_retrieval_chain](https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest/chains/langchain.chains.retrieval.create_retrieval_chain.html), which returns sources by default;
2. Using a simple [LCEL](/docs/concepts#langchain-expression-language) implementation, to show the operating principle.

## Setup

### Dependencies

We'll use OpenAI embeddings and a Chroma vector store in this walkthrough, but everything shown here works with any [Embeddings](/docs/concepts#embedding-models), [VectorStore](/docs/concepts#vectorstores) or [Retriever](/docs/concepts#retrievers). 

We'll use the following packages:


```python
%pip install --upgrade --quiet  langchain langchain-community langchainhub langchain-openai langchain-chroma bs4
```

We need to set environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY`, which can be done directly or loaded from a `.env` file like so:


```python
import getpass
import os

os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = getpass.getpass()

# import dotenv

# dotenv.load_dotenv()
```

### LangSmith

Many of the applications you build with LangChain will contain multiple steps with multiple invocations of LLM calls. As these applications get more and more complex, it becomes crucial to be able to inspect what exactly is going on inside your chain or agent. The best way to do this is with [LangSmith](https://smith.langchain.com).

Note that LangSmith is not needed, but it is helpful. If you do want to use LangSmith, after you sign up at the link above, make sure to set your environment variables to start logging traces:


```python
os.environ["LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2"] = "true"
os.environ["LANGCHAIN_API_KEY"] = getpass.getpass()
```

## Using `create_retrieval_chain`

Let's first select a LLM:

```{=mdx}
import ChatModelTabs from "@theme/ChatModelTabs";

<ChatModelTabs customVarName="llm" />
```


```python
# | output: false
# | echo: false

from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

llm = ChatOpenAI()
```

Here is Q&A app with sources we built over the [LLM Powered Autonomous Agents](https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-06-23-agent/) blog post by Lilian Weng in the [RAG tutorial](/docs/tutorials/rag):


```python

from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate
from langchain_openai import OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain_text_splitters import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter

# 1. Load, chunk and index the contents of the blog to create a retriever.
loader = WebBaseLoader(
    web_paths=("https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-06-23-agent/",),
    bs_kwargs=dict(
        parse_only=bs4.SoupStrainer(
            class_=("post-content", "post-title", "post-header")
        )
    ),
)
docs = loader.load()

text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=200)
splits = text_splitter.split_documents(docs)
vectorstore = Chroma.from_documents(documents=splits, embedding=OpenAIEmbeddings())
retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever()


# 2. Incorporate the retriever into a question-answering chain.
system_prompt = (
    "You are an assistant for question-answering tasks. "
    "Use the following pieces of retrieved context to answer "
    "the question. If you don't know the answer, say that you "
    "don't know. Use three sentences maximum and keep the "
    "answer concise."
    "\n\n"
    "{context}"
)

prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages(
    [
        ("system", system_prompt),
        ("human", "{input}"),
    ]
)

question_answer_chain = create_stuff_documents_chain(llm, prompt)
rag_chain = create_retrieval_chain(retriever, question_answer_chain)
```


```python
result = rag_chain.invoke({"input": "What is Task Decomposition?"})
```

Note that `result` is a dict with keys `"input"`, `"context"`, and `"answer"`:


```python
result
```

Here, `"context"` contains the sources that the LLM used in generating the response in `"answer"`.

## Custom LCEL implementation

Below we construct a chain similar to those built by `create_retrieval_chain`. It works by building up a dict: 

1. Starting with a dict with the input query, add the retrieved docs in the `"context"` key;
2. Feed both the query and context into a RAG chain and add the result to the dict.


```python
from langchain_core.output_parsers import StrOutputParser
from langchain_core.runnables import RunnablePassthrough


def format_docs(docs):
    return "\n\n".join(doc.page_content for doc in docs)


rag_chain_from_docs = (
    RunnablePassthrough.assign(context=(lambda x: format_docs(x["context"])))
    | prompt
    | llm
    | StrOutputParser()
)

retrieve_docs = (lambda x: x["input"]) | retriever

chain = RunnablePassthrough.assign(context=retrieve_docs).assign(
    answer=rag_chain_from_docs
)

chain.invoke({"input": "What is Task Decomposition"})
```
